# Raman-spectroscopy-database
This project is to make user interface database of avaiable raman spectra of samples. Raman spectrum are basically plots of intensity vs raman shift. 
These datas are taken from Raman spectrometer instrument at Bhabha Atomic Research Center,Mumbai. 
So when the user selects elements from periodic table, first it will give all possible combination with the selected elements. From these combination user can select any one of them . And finally it will give raman spectrum of that molecule.
